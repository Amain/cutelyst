Description: A C++ Web Framework built on top of Qt - development headers
 A Web Framework built on top of Qt, using the simple and elegant approach of
 Catalyst (Perl) framework. Qt's meta object system is what powers the core of
 Cutelyst, it allows for introspecting controller's methods signatures and
 generate matching actions that can be invoked later.
 .
 * Cross-platform
 * Stable API/ABI - v1 on v1.x.x branch and v2 on tagged from master
 * Pluggable Engines
 * Cutelyst-WSGI - A cross-platform and fast WSGI engine
   * HTTP/1.1 - Pipelining and Keep-Alive
   * HTTP/2 - Upgrade to H2, ALPN negotiation on HTTPS and direct H2C
   * FastCGI - Pipelining and Keep-Alive
 * uWSGI - Multiple protocols support (HTTP 1.0, FastCGI, uWSGI)
 * WebSockets
 * REST with ActionREST
 * Plugin based views (Cutelee, Grantlee, Clearsilver)
 * Asynchronous processing
 * QtCreator integration
